## What is Cross-Chain Custody?

Cross-Chain Custody lets your users hold and control assets on any blockchain using a single existing wallet signature. Through [NEAR's Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures) (built on multi-party computation), a key on one chain derives unique, native addresses on every other chain — and signs transactions on those chains — without ever generating a new private key. The system is fully non-custodial: only the user controls the key material.

Your ETH key controls a native Bitcoin address. Your Zcash key controls a Base address. One signature, assets everywhere — and the assets are truly native, not wrapped or synthetic.

## How Chain Signatures Work

NEAR's Chain Signatures layer consists of three interconnected components:

**Deterministic address derivation.** A user's NEAR-controlled identity (which can be derived from any chain's wallet via chain abstraction) combines with a derivation path (e.g., `bitcoin-1`, `solana-2`) to produce a unique, reproducible address on any target chain. No randomness — given the same key and path, you always get the same address.

**The `v1.signer` smart contract.** This NEAR contract accepts signature requests: a payload to sign, a derivation path, and a signing curve (Secp256k1 for EVM/Bitcoin, Ed25519 for Solana/Cosmos). It holds execution until the MPC service responds.

**MPC signing service.** Independent nodes collectively produce a signature. No single node can sign alone — they generate partial signature shares aggregated across multiple rounds into a valid signature. The system is fully non-custodial: only the user controls the key material. No third party — including NEAR — can sign on the user's behalf. The network is live on NEAR mainnet today.

## Why This Matters for Builders

Today, supporting multiple chains means multiple signing schemes, multiple key derivation standards, and months of per-chain engineering. Cross-Chain Custody collapses this:

- **One integration → 31 chains.** Integrate NEAR Intents once and your wallet supports all supported chains, including Bitcoin, Solana, Cosmos, Zcash, XRP, EVM chains, and more.
- **True native custody.** Assets live on the destination chain — not bridged, not wrapped, not synthetic. Native BTC on Bitcoin. Native USDC on Base.
- **No new UX surface.** Users never manage a second seed phrase or install a second wallet. Their existing key is the master.
- **Institutional grade.** MPC security model with no single point of failure — no one node can sign independently.

## Supported Chains & Curves

Chain Signatures supports **Secp256k1** (EVM chains, Bitcoin, XRP, Zcash) and **Ed25519** (Solana, Cosmos, Aptos, Sui). This covers the vast majority of blockchain ecosystems. If NEAR Intents supports a chain for swaps, Chain Signatures can derive and control addresses on it.

## For Custodians and Institutions

Institutional custody today requires separate key material per chain — each with its own HSM configuration, backup strategy, and operational risk. Chain Signatures offers a different model: one master key, one signing ceremony, all chains. Audit one key, not thirty-one.

## The Chain Abstraction Advantage

Chain Signatures is the underlying primitive that powers cross-chain swaps, payments, and bridging in NEAR Intents. Custody is the foundation: before you can move assets cross-chain, you need to control cross-chain addresses. Build on this layer and every other NEAR Intents capability becomes available to your users.
