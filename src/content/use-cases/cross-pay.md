## What is Cross-Pay?

Cross-Pay lets your users pay anyone with any token they hold, on any chain — while the recipient receives exactly the stablecoin amount they requested, on the chain they prefer. The sender doesn't need to worry about bridges, conversions, or which chain the recipient uses. Any overpayment returns to the sender automatically in their original token.

This turns any wallet or payment app into a universal payment rail.

## How it Works

1. **Payment request is created** — recipient specifies the exact stablecoin amount (e.g., 500 USDC on Base)
2. **Sender selects their payment source** — any token on any chain (e.g., BTC on Bitcoin)
3. **NEAR Intents routes the payment** — converting and delivering in one step through competing solvers
4. **Sender signs one transaction** — on their source chain, or sends to a deposit address
5. **Recipient receives exactly what they requested** — precise stablecoin amount, no slippage

## Why This Matters

Today, crypto payments are broken by chain fragmentation. A Bitcoin holder can't easily pay someone who wants USDC on Base. A Solana user can't send stablecoins to an Ethereum address without multiple steps. Cross-Pay eliminates this friction entirely.

For **wallets**: your users can pay anyone without leaving your app. You capture fee revenue on every payment and stop losing users to CEXes for token conversion.

For **payment apps and merchants**: accept crypto from 31 chains with one integration. Your addressable market expands from "users on your chain" to every crypto holder globally.

For **any app handling payments**: generate payment links and QR codes that any sender can pay with their existing wallet — no special wallet support required from you.

## Integration Options

- **Widget** — Drop-in payment UI. Integration time: ~1 day.
- **API** — Full control over the payment UX. Integration time: ~1 week.
- **Payment Links** — Shareable links and QR codes the payer opens in any wallet. Zero integration required on the sender side.
