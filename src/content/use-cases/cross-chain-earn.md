  default: "Every cross-chain deposit into a yield position = a transaction fee you weren't capturing before"
  lending: "BTC holders, ETH holders, SOL holders — any asset, any chain can supply to your lending market. Stop leaving collateral on the table."
  yield-vault: "Any user on any chain can deposit into your vault in one step. No bridging friction means more deposits, higher TVL, more fees."

      - "To exit: clicks 'Withdraw' → receives native BTC back to their Bitcoin address"

    detail: "Your UI shows the user's held assets — BTC, ETH, SOL, ZEC, and 100+ more — alongside yield opportunities you've configured (lending markets, staking protocols, yield vaults). The user picks their source asset on their chain and the earn position they want. They don't need a wallet on the destination chain."

    title: NEAR Intents converts and routes in one step
    detail: "Solvers compete to convert the user's source asset and deposit it into the target yield protocol at the best available rate. NEAR Intents handles the cross-chain routing, asset conversion, and protocol deposit atomically — no intermediate steps the user needs to manage. You configure your fee, charged on the deposit."

    title: User signs once — or sends to a deposit address
    detail: "If the user has a connected wallet, they sign one transaction on their source chain. If not, generate a static deposit address. The user sends native BTC, SOL, or ETH from any wallet. No chain-specific wallet required on the destination."

    title: Yield accrues — withdraw back to original asset anytime
    detail: "The position opens on the destination protocol and yield begins accruing immediately. When the user withdraws, NEAR Intents routes the yield position back through the solver network — they receive their original asset on their original chain, plus yield, in one step. No manual unwinding."

  feeStructure: "Configurable fee on deposit and withdrawal — typically 20 to 100 basis points each way. Fees are fully customizable per route and protocol, so you can set premium fees for complex cross-chain earn flows and lower fees for same-chain deposits. You keep the fees you configure."

## What is Cross-Chain Earn?

Cross-Chain Earn lets users go from any asset on any chain into a yield-bearing position on another chain — in one step. No bridging, no swapping, no manually depositing into a protocol. NEAR Intents handles asset conversion, cross-chain routing, and protocol deposit in a single transaction. When the user is ready to exit, they withdraw back to their original asset on their original chain the same way.

The biggest barrier to DeFi participation isn't yield — it's friction. Cross-Chain Earn removes it. Your protocol's yield becomes accessible to every crypto holder on every chain, including native BTC holders who have never touched an EVM chain. For lending protocols, liquid staking, and yield vaults, this expands the addressable depositor base from "users already on your chain" to the entire crypto market.
