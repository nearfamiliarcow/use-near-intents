## What is Cross-Chain Swaps?

Cross-Chain Swaps lets your users swap any token on any chain for any other token on any other chain — directly inside your app. No bridging, no multiple transactions, no leaving your UI.

NEAR Intents handles the routing automatically. Your user selects source and destination, signs one transaction, and the swap completes in ~30 seconds across 31 supported chains.

## How it Works

1. **User initiates a swap** in your app (e.g., ETH on Ethereum → SOL on Solana)
2. **NEAR Intents finds the optimal route** through its solver network
3. **User signs one transaction** on their source chain
4. **Solvers execute the swap** — depositing the destination token to the user
5. **Settlement happens on NEAR** — trustless, verifiable, fast
