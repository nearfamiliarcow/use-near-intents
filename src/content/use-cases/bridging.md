## Bridging

NEAR Intents can bridge any supported asset to any supported chain — ZEC to Solana, BTC to NEAR, DOGE to Base, STRK to Arbitrum, any combination. When new chains are added to the network, your asset can be bridged there too — automatically. No swap fees, no slippage — bridging is one-to-one. UTXO chains like Bitcoin, Zcash, and Dogecoin are supported natively.

We make bridging your asset to other chains extremely simple and convenient — and give it access to all the liquidity of the NEAR Intents protocol.
