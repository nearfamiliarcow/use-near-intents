## Why Solana?

Solana is one of the largest and fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems — home to major DEXs, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, and a rapidly expanding DeFi stack. With sub-second finality and low fees, it's where a huge share of on-chain activity happens.

But Solana had a cross-chain problem. Assets from UTXO chains — Zcash, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin — had no clean native path onto Solana. Bridges mostly covered EVM chains. For ZEC holders specifically, there was no direct path at all.

## The Problem

Before NEAR Intents, a ZEC holder who wanted to participate in Solana DeFi had no straightforward option. They would need to sell ZEC on a CEX, buy SOL or USDC, transfer to Solana, then deposit into a DeFi app. Four steps, multiple accounts, 20-40 minutes, and significant fees.

The problem was systemic. UTXO chain holders — representing tens of millions of crypto users across Bitcoin, Zcash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin — were effectively locked out of Solana unless they used a centralized exchange as an intermediary. No bridge handled UTXO chains natively.

## Two Changes, One Integration

The Solana integration with NEAR Intents operated at two levels.

**First, Solana was added to the NEAR Intents network.** This is the chain-level event. NEAR Intents now recognizes Solana as both a source and destination chain, meaning its solver network can route assets to and from Solana. Every app on Solana inherits this capability.

**Second, Zcash (and other UTXO assets) became bridgeable to Solana.** ZEC holders can now send native ZEC and receive assets on Solana — directly, without a CEX, without wrapped token complexity.

## What Changed for Users

The most concrete change is for ZEC holders. A ZEC holder selects Zcash as their source chain, specifies how much ZEC to bridge, and signs one transaction. NEAR Intents routes the asset through its solver network — handling the UTXO chain complexity, the cross-chain routing, and the delivery to Solana. The user sees a preview, confirms, and waits roughly 30 seconds.

The same flow works for BTC holders on Bitcoin, ETH holders on Ethereum, or users on any of the other 31 supported chains. All roads now lead to Solana.

## What Changed for the Ecosystem

Solana joining NEAR Intents is a compounding event. Every Solana application that integrates NEAR Intents gets 31-chain access without building bridge infrastructure. The cost of cross-chain connectivity collapses to a single API integration.

For the Solana ecosystem, this means TVL growth can now come from holders on any of 31 chains — including Bitcoin, Zcash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin communities that were historically underserved by DeFi bridges. These communities now have a first-class path into Solana.
