## Why near.com?

near.com is the official home of the NEAR Protocol — the first place developers, users, and newcomers land when they encounter NEAR. It's not just a marketing site. It's the primary interface for the NEAR ecosystem: wallet, explorer, and now, swap.

The decision to ship a cross-chain swap feature directly into near.com — using NEAR Intents — is both a product choice and a statement of confidence. The NEAR team built the swap experience they wanted every partner to be able to offer.

## The Problem

Until recently, near.com had no built-in way to move or trade assets. A user holding Bitcoin who wanted NEAR had to leave the site, find a bridge or DEX that supported NEAR, navigate an unfamiliar interface, and come back. Each step in that journey is a user who doesn't return.

For the NEAR ecosystem, the homepage was a dead end for users who arrived with assets on other chains. There was no native path from "I have ETH" to "I'm in the NEAR ecosystem."

## The Integration

NEAR Intents powers the swap feature at near.com directly. Users select their source asset — BTC, ETH, SOL, or any of 100+ supported tokens — choose a destination, and get an immediate quote. The interface shows exactly what they'll receive before they confirm.

The screenshot shows a live example: 1.2 BTC quoted at 81,601 USDC. No bridge UI, no wrapped token selection, no manual chain configuration. The user sees input and output. They confirm once. NEAR Intents routes the trade through its solver network and settles in roughly 30 seconds.

The integration covers 31 chains and 100+ assets — the full NEAR Intents network — available from the NEAR Protocol's own front door.

## What This Means for Partners

near.com is a reference implementation. When NEAR introduces NEAR Intents to a prospective partner, the pitch is simple: the same swap experience live at near.com is what you can ship.

The near.com integration demonstrates that NEAR Intents is production-ready at the highest-stakes integration point in the ecosystem. If the official NEAR website trusts NEAR Intents to power its swap feature, that signal carries weight in every partner conversation that follows.

## Cross-Chain Custody

near.com is a unified interface for multi-chain assets. Users log in with one wallet — a passkey wallet, any EVM wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.), or a NEAR native wallet — and that's the only key they ever need. From there, they can deposit from any supported chain to fund their account, and withdraw to any supported chain when they need to move assets out.

While using near.com, the user never has to think about what chain they're on. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Zcash — it's all accessible from one place with one login. No juggling multiple wallets, no managing separate seed phrases, no switching between chain-specific apps. The complexity of 31 chains collapses into a single, seamless experience.

## Cross-Chain Earn

near.com lets users put their assets to work across chains without leaving the interface. A BTC holder can deposit Bitcoin and earn yield on Base lending markets. An ETH holder can stake for stETH yield. NEAR Intents handles the conversion, deposits into the yield protocol, and when the user is ready to withdraw, converts back to their original asset. Earn from anywhere, withdraw to anywhere.

## Asset Onboarding

Depositing onto near.com functions like a centralized exchange — but it's fully non-custodial. Users get a deposit address for any supported asset, send their coins from anywhere (a wallet, an exchange, cold storage), and their near.com account is funded. All funds are accessible through their connected wallet. No bridging steps, no chain switching. Just deposit and go.
